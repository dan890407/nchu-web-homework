                Regarding the false report on the selection of the dean of the School of Management by some media on September 26, 109, the school has officially sent a letter on September 28 to request a fair report. In response to many references in the text, our school explained as follows:

                1. [Xingda Card Management Case 1], [Xingda Card Management Case 2] The selection of the dean of the School of Management is controversial. The school has proactively released the explanatory draft on September 23, 109. <a href="https://www2 .nchu.edu.tw/news-detail/id/49511"" target="_self">(https://www2.nchu.edu.tw/news-detail/id/49511)</a>, the selection process Follow the rules for the selection, renewal and dismissal of the dean of the school.

                Low GI (glycemic index) diet is in the lead. Professor Wang Qiangsheng from the Department of Agronomy of Chung Hsing University has been studying rice for more than 20 years. He led a team to develop Taiwan’s first Penglai low-glycemic rice variety "Xingda No. 3", which has now applied for variety rights. It is expected to be authorized before the end of the year. He said that he hopes to reach the ultimate goal of raising all kinds of people
                In recent years, Wang Qiangsheng has observed changes in people’s dietary habits and rising awareness of health preservation. The amount of rice consumed by Chinese people has fallen by more than half in 20 years, prompting him to start thinking about Taiwan’s rice industry and technical strength, but obese and diabetic patients are often unable to do so because of health factors. To eat to the fullest, Wang Qiangsheng's team hopes to develop "low-glycemic rice" to avoid rapid blood sugar spikes and less likely to gain weight or hunger, so as to achieve "a hundred kinds of rice to feed a hundred people" and meet the different needs of the people.
