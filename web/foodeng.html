            <h2>比時地美式漢堡炸雞</h2>
            <p>Push it! The last time I went to Chung Hsing University was really untestable. I didn’t expect to find so many delicious foods when I went to the student restaurant this time. Among them, I caught my eyeballs more than this one: American-style hamburger fried chicken nowadays. I haven't paid attention to this place? And when I asked the clerk, I realized that Bishidi American Burger Fried Chicken has been in business for 3 years, and there are already 5 stores, and the main store is on Hiking Road.</p>
